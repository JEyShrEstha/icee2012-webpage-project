							In addition to the topical program and the conference materials, the full registration fee included lunches, refreshments and social events. The social events formed an important part of the ICEE 2012 experience and provided opportunities to discuss and network with colleagues and, naturally, to enjoy the Finnish hospitality and local culture.

							<b>Get-together Event:</b> Most of the conference participants arrived in Turku during Monday, July 30. There was an opportunity to register oneself and get together with colleagues in the <a href="http://www.panimoravintolakoulu.fi/?lang=en" target="_blank">Brewery Restaurant Koulu</a> that is well known of its own locally brewed beer. The restaurant, a former compulsory school building, is located in Turku city center close to the conference hotels.

							<p>
							<b>Welcome Reception:</b> On Tuesday evening the City of Turku hosted a reception and wished all the conference participants welcome to Turku and Finland. The event was arranged in the lobby and garden of the <a href="http://www.aboavetusarsnova.fi/en" target="_blank">Aboa Vetus & Ars Nova Museum</a> located in the very heart of the city.

							<b>Gala Dinner & iNEER Awards Ceremony:</b><br>The gala dinner took place in <a href="http://www.turunlinna.fi/en/index.html" target="_blank">Turku Castle</a> on Wednesday evening. Turku Castle is a significant landmark at the mouth of Aura River. The castle is part of the Finnish cultural and architectural heritage as an architectural monument, a museum and as premises for distinguished celebrations. The castle is one of the most favorite tourist attractions and most visited museums in Finland and it provided an excellent venue for a memorable conference dinner.

						<h3 class="first_heading">Trips and Visits</h3>
						<p>
						Different trips and visits were offered for the conference participants by the Congress Office of the University of Turku (<a href="http://www.icee2012.fi/images/documents/icee2012_trips_www.pdf" target="_blank"><b>click here to find more information</b></a>). Unfortunately, there were not enough participants to any of the trips and, thus, no common trips will be arranged. The fees will be refunded to those who did register to the trips and pay the fees already. If you have questions concerning the trips or the refunds, please contact the Congress Office of the University of Turku by email <a href="mailto:congress@utu.fi">congress@utu.fi</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
						However, Turku and the nearby cities offered versatile opportunities to get familiar with the different perspectives of the local culture and nature. The conference package included a comprehensive local tourist guide and the Turku Tourist office & ICEE 2012 Front desk helped to find the events and attractions!
